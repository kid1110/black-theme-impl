# black-theme-impl
## At the begining
I want to understand how Dark Mode is implemented, and since I'm a Vue enthusiast, I'm planning to achieve it using Vue 3. Although it can be implemented in native front-end as well, this project is a demo or you could call it a toy. Perhaps I might even learn to encapsulate a function, similar to vueUse project. If you're also curious about the implementation of Dark Mode, you can take a look at the source code here. Hopefully, it can provide you with some valuable insights. 



## Usage
```shell
cd black-theme-impl
npm install
npm run dev
```
